# Multithreaded Web Server

Rust Book final project: Basic web server that uses a thread pool to respond asynchronously, including graceful shutdown of the server, which cleans up all the threads in the pool.

Ideas to continue enhancing this project:

Add more documentation to ThreadPool and its public methods.
Add tests of the libraryâ€™s functionality.
Change calls to unwrap to more robust error handling.
Use ThreadPool to perform some task other than serving web requests.
Find a thread pool crate on crates.io and implement a similar web server using the crate instead. Then compare its API and robustness to the thread pool we implemented.
